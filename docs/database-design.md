# Database Design — `order_service`

Postgres 15+, sharded per region. PostGIS enabled (for delivery agent presence + geospatial assignment).

This document specifies every table this service owns, its columns, FKs (in-shard only — see §Cross-service references), indexes (each justified by a query), and the sharding plan.

The schema diverges from the rough draft in `img_2.png` per project guidance:
- **No `payouts` table.** Payouts are recorded as a row in `transactions` with `transaction_type='payout'`.
- **Money columns are `INT` minor units**, not `DECIMAL` (see CLAUDE.md §7).
- `src_acc_id` / `dst_acc_id` reference `core_service.users.id` (logical, no FK). For restaurants, use the **owner user id**. For platform-side rows (commission, refund-from-platform), `src_acc_id` is `NULL` to denote SYSTEM.
- **No `incentives` tables.**
- **No `events_outbox` table.** This service does not emit outbound async events in this milestone (no analytics consumer; no other consumer needs it). Async with core-service is inbound-only — see `docs/system-design.md` §5.
- **No `customer_order_index` table.** With country-level shards (one DB per country), customers ordering across regions are rare; if/when needed, the cross-region history view will be implemented as a fan-out at the controller level. Removed to keep the milestone surface area small.
- **No `deliveries` table.** Per-order delivery state already lives on `orders` (`status`, `delivery_agent_id`, `assigned_at`/`picked_at`/`delivered_at`). The reassignment chain audit is replaced by an `assignment_attempts INT` counter on `orders` (per-attempt who-rejected lives ephemerally in Redis: `assign:reject:<orderId>`).
- New tables added: `idempotency_keys`, `payment_sessions`, `payment_webhook_events`, `agent_presence`, `agent_earnings`, `restaurant_balances`. **No `core_inbound_events`** — inbound-event dedupe lives in Redis (`core-events:dedupe:<eventId>`, SETNX, 24h TTL), not SQL.

---

## 0. Conventions

- Every table has `id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY` unless noted.
- Every sharded table has `region TEXT NOT NULL` immediately after `id`.
- `created_at`, `updated_at` are `TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()` for hot rows. Status-transition timestamps (`accepted_at`, `picked_at`, etc.) are `TIMESTAMP NULL` until the transition happens.
- Money columns are `INT NOT NULL` storing minor units. A `currency` column lives next to them or on the parent (`orders.currency`).
- Enum-like columns are `TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(col IN ('a','b'))` (matches core-service convention). Native PG `ENUM` is reserved for `currency_enum` which already exists in core.
- Index naming: `idx_<table>_<col>[_<col>]`. Constraint naming: `fk_<table>_<col>`, `uq_<table>_<col>`.
- Every FK has a supporting btree index (Postgres does not auto-index FK columns).

## 1. Cross-service references (logical, no DB FK)

| Logical reference         | Where in this service                                | Source of truth     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `users.id`                | `orders.customer_id`, `transactions.src_acc_id`, `transactions.dst_acc_id`, `deliveries.agent_id`, `agent_presence.agent_id`, `agent_earnings.agent_id` | `core-service.users` |
| `customer_addresses.id`   | `orders.customer_address_id`                         | `core-service.customer_addresses` |
| `restaurants.id`          | `orders.restaurant_id`, `restaurant_balances.restaurant_id` | `core-service.restaurants` |
| `restaurant_branches.id`  | `orders.branch_id`                                   | `core-service.restaurant_branches` |
| `products.id`             | `order_items.product_id`                             | `core-service.products` |

These are validated **at write time** via the `core-client` (sync HTTP) when the data is not already proven (e.g. by JWT claims or a recent cache hit). For repeatedly hot lookups (branch metadata, product price/stock), we maintain a Redis read-through cache populated from `core-service`.

We snapshot critical fields at order time (`order_items.name_snapshot`, `unit_price_snapshot`, `image_url_snapshot`) so historical orders remain readable even after the source row changes or is deleted.

---

## 2. Sharding plan

### Shard key: country

The shard key is the **country code**: `eg`, `ksa`, ... — one Postgres cluster per country. The DB column is named `region` so the router stays generic if we ever sub-shard a country later, but in this milestone `region == country code`.

### Resolution

For every request, the region is resolved (in order):
1. Path/query: explicit `?region=` (admin endpoints; `region=all` permitted on fan-out reads only).
2. Header: `X-Region` (gateway-supplied or client-supplied on guest checkout).
3. Cookie: `region=<code>`.
4. For customer order placement: derived from the chosen `branchId` — branches are tied to a country in `core-service`.

Region is **not** a JWT claim (we dropped it — keeps tokens stateless per shard decision).

The `KNEX_CONNECTION` provider (in `lib/database.providers.ts`) exposes `db(region)` to return a `Knex` instance for the resolved region. Repositories inject it via `@Inject('KNEX_CONNECTION')` and use `trx?: Knex.Transaction` on every mutating method, exactly like core-service:

```ts
@Injectable()
export class OrderRepository {
    constructor(@Inject('KNEX_CONNECTION') private readonly knex: ShardedKnex) {}

    async findOrderById(region: string, id: number, trx?: Knex.Transaction): Promise<OrderEntity | undefined> {
        const db = trx ?? this.knex.db(region);
        // ...
    }
}
```

There is no fallback "global" connection in business code. Migrations iterate over the configured regions list.

### Read replicas

Not introduced in this milestone. All reads and writes go to the primary per region. We will revisit when traffic justifies adding replicas.

### Cross-shard reads

Forbidden in the hot path. The only handled case is:
1. **System-admin global views** (e.g. all pending orders across countries) — fan-out at the controller level, sequential, with hard pagination per shard. With ~2 countries today (`eg`, `ksa`) this is cheap.

### Tables that ARE sharded

`orders`, `order_items`, `transactions`, `restaurant_balances`, `agent_presence`, `agent_earnings`, `idempotency_keys`, `payment_sessions`, `payment_webhook_events`.

### Tables that ARE NOT sharded (replicated to every shard, or live once)

`payment_providers` — small lookup, replicated. Treat as read-only seed.

### Cold archive (Phase 7)

A separate Postgres cluster per region (`order_service_archive`) holds rows older than the current year. Same schema as the hot DB. The archival worker copies and deletes — see `docs/implementation-plan.md` Phase 7.

## 3. Tables

### 3.1 `orders`

Primary write target of this service. Holds the order header.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id              BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    region          TEXT NOT NULL,                                -- shard key
    public_id       UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE,                         -- client-facing id
    country_code    TEXT NOT NULL,
    restaurant_id   BIGINT NOT NULL,                              -- logical FK -> core.restaurants.id
    branch_id       BIGINT NOT NULL,                              -- logical FK -> core.restaurant_branches.id
    customer_id     BIGINT NOT NULL,                              -- logical FK -> core.users.id
    customer_address_id BIGINT NOT NULL,                          -- logical FK -> core.customer_addresses.id
    -- delivery snapshot (so the address survives after the customer edits/deletes it)
    delivery_lat    DECIMAL(10,7) NOT NULL,
    delivery_lng    DECIMAL(10,7) NOT NULL,
    delivery_address_text_snapshot TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- status machine
    status          TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN (
                        'pending_payment','placed','accepted','rejected',
                        'preparing','ready','assigned','picked','delivered','cancelled'
                    )),
    -- money (minor units)
    subtotal        INT NOT NULL,
    delivery_fee    INT NOT NULL,
    service_fee     INT NOT NULL,
    total           INT NOT NULL,                                 -- subtotal + delivery_fee + service_fee
    commission      INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,                       -- platform cut, computed at delivery
    currency        TEXT NOT NULL,                                -- 'EGP','SAR'
    payment_method  TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (payment_method IN ('online','cod')),
    -- delivery (no separate `deliveries` table; per-order state lives here)
    delivery_agent_id BIGINT,                                     -- nullable until assigned; current agent for this order
    assignment_attempts INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,                   -- bumped each tryAssign; enforces MAX_REASSIGNMENT_ATTEMPTS
    last_assignment_at TIMESTAMP NULL,                            -- bookkeeping for the assignment loop watchdog
    -- timestamps
    created_at      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    accepted_at     TIMESTAMP NULL,
    rejected_at     TIMESTAMP NULL,
    ready_at        TIMESTAMP NULL,
    assigned_at     TIMESTAMP NULL,
    picked_at       TIMESTAMP NULL,
    delivered_at    TIMESTAMP NULL,
    cancelled_at    TIMESTAMP NULL
);

-- supports GET /orders/{publicId}                               (customer & restaurant lookup)
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_public_id ON orders (public_id);
-- supports GET /customer/orders?year=YYYY                       (customer history, current year hot)
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id_created_at ON orders (customer_id, created_at DESC);
-- supports GET /restaurant/orders?branchId=&status=&from=&to=   (most queried — restaurant ops dashboard)
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_branch_status_created_at ON orders (branch_id, status, created_at DESC);
-- supports DELIVERY assignment scan for pending assignment in a region
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status_created_at ON orders (status, created_at) WHERE status IN ('ready','assigned');
-- supports GET /agents/tasks?status=
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_delivery_agent_id_status ON orders (delivery_agent_id, status) WHERE delivery_agent_id IS NOT NULL;
```

Notes:
- `public_id` (UUID) is what we expose. The bigint `id` stays internal.
- `total` is denormalized for read efficiency; recomputed and asserted at insert and on any line-item change.
- We store `delivery_address_text_snapshot` and lat/lng on the order so the order remains coherent if the user later deletes the saved address.

---

### 3.2 `order_items`

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id                  BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    region              TEXT NOT NULL,
    order_id            BIGINT NOT NULL,
    product_id          BIGINT NOT NULL,                          -- logical FK -> core.products.id
    quantity            INT NOT NULL CHECK (quantity > 0),
    unit_price_snapshot INT NOT NULL,                             -- minor units, frozen at order time
    name_snapshot       TEXT NOT NULL,
    image_url_snapshot  TEXT NULL,
    line_total          INT NOT NULL,                             -- quantity * unit_price_snapshot
    created_at          TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

    CONSTRAINT fk_order_items_order_id FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- supports GET /orders/{orderId} expansion (single batch fetch via whereIn for lists)
CREATE INDEX idx_order_items_order_id ON order_items (order_id);
-- (no product_id index — we never query items by product in this service; analytics service will)
```

---

### 3.3 `payment_providers` (lookup, NOT sharded — same data on every shard)

```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_providers (
    id          INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name        TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,                              -- 'kashier','cod'
    is_enabled  BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
    priority    SMALLINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 100
);

-- seeded:
-- (1, 'kashier', true, 10)
-- (2, 'cod',     true, 20)
```

No indexes beyond PK + the unique on `name`. Tiny lookup table.

---

### 3.4 `payment_sessions` (Kashier session lifecycle)

A Kashier "Payment Session" is created before redirecting the customer. We store the local mirror so we can correlate webhook events.

```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_sessions (
    id              BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    region          TEXT NOT NULL,
    order_id        BIGINT NOT NULL,
    provider_id     INT NOT NULL,                                 -- FK to payment_providers (logically — providers replicated)
    provider_session_id TEXT NOT NULL,                            -- Kashier's session id
    redirect_url    TEXT NOT NULL,
    amount          INT NOT NULL,                                 -- minor units
    currency        TEXT NOT NULL,
    status          TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN (
                        'initialized','pending','authorized','captured','failed','expired','cancelled'
                    )),
    raw_init_payload  JSONB NOT NULL,                             -- what we sent to Kashier
    raw_last_payload  JSONB NULL,                                 -- last update from Kashier
    created_at      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

    CONSTRAINT fk_payment_sessions_order_id FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id),
    CONSTRAINT uq_payment_sessions_provider_session_id UNIQUE (provider_session_id)
);

-- supports webhook lookup by Kashier session id
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_sessions_provider_session_id ON payment_sessions (provider_session_id);
-- supports order -> session lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_sessions_order_id ON payment_sessions (order_id);
```

---

### 3.5 `transactions`

The money ledger. Every money movement is one row. Includes payments, refunds, commissions, and **payouts** (so we don't need a separate `payouts` table).

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    id                  BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    region              TEXT NOT NULL,
    order_id            BIGINT NULL,                              -- nullable for payouts not tied to an order
    transaction_type    TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (transaction_type IN (
                            'charge','refund','commission','payout','cod_collection','adjustment'
                        )),
    method              TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (method IN ('online','cod','bank_transfer','system')),
    provider_id         INT NULL,                                 -- nullable for non-provider tx (e.g. commission)
    provider_reference_id TEXT NULL,                              -- Kashier txn id / bank ref
    status              TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending','succeeded','failed','reversed')),
    amount              INT NOT NULL,                             -- minor units, always positive
    currency            TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- accounting (logical user ids in core)
    src_acc_id          BIGINT NULL,                              -- NULL => SYSTEM (platform)
    dst_acc_id          BIGINT NULL,                              -- NULL => SYSTEM
    -- refund linkage
    is_refunded         BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    refunded_payment_id BIGINT NULL,
    -- idempotency from upstream (e.g. webhook event id)
    idempotency_key     TEXT NULL,
    created_at          TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at          TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

    CONSTRAINT fk_transactions_order_id FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_transactions_refunded_payment_id FOREIGN KEY (refunded_payment_id) REFERENCES transactions(id),
    CONSTRAINT uq_transactions_idempotency_key UNIQUE (idempotency_key)
);

-- supports GET /payments/{id} (admin lookup)
-- (PK lookup via id is the public id for transactions; no extra index needed)

-- supports order detail expansion (1 round trip per order's tx ledger)
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_order_id ON transactions (order_id);
-- supports webhook idempotency lookup by provider reference
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_provider_reference_id ON transactions (provider_reference_id) WHERE provider_reference_id IS NOT NULL;
-- supports restaurant payout history: GET /restaurant/payouts?from=&to=
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_dst_acc_type_created_at ON transactions (dst_acc_id, transaction_type, created_at DESC) WHERE transaction_type = 'payout';
-- supports finance reconciliation by status + type
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_type_status_created_at ON transactions (transaction_type, status, created_at DESC);
```

Why no separate `payouts` table:
- Same columns are needed (amount, currency, src/dst, provider ref, status, timestamps).
- One ledger to query; no JOIN; payout history is a filter on `transaction_type='payout'`.
- The unique constraint on `idempotency_key` lets us safely re-record a payout from an admin retry.

---

### 3.6 `restaurant_balances`

One row per (restaurant, currency) — restaurants may operate in multiple regions/currencies, but for now (single currency per restaurant) it's effectively one row per restaurant.

```sql
CREATE TABLE restaurant_balances (
    restaurant_id   BIGINT NOT NULL,
    region          TEXT NOT NULL,
    currency        TEXT NOT NULL,
    balance         INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,                       -- minor units
    updated_at      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (restaurant_id, currency)
);

-- balance is incremented on order delivered (subtotal - commission), decremented on payout.
-- single-row lookup by (restaurant_id, currency) is the only query — PK suffices.
```

Updates use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` inside the same transaction as the delivery state transition or payout insert.

---

### 3.7 ~~`deliveries`~~ — removed

Per-order delivery state lives directly on `orders`:

| Concept | Where it lives |
| --- | --- |
| Current agent for the order | `orders.delivery_agent_id` |
| Status (`assigned/picked/delivered/cancelled`) | `orders.status` (single status machine) |
| Lifecycle timestamps (`assigned_at`, `picked_at`, `delivered_at`, `cancelled_at`) | `orders.*_at` |
| Reassignment count + watchdog | `orders.assignment_attempts`, `orders.last_assignment_at` |
| Who rejected this attempt | Redis `assign:reject:<orderId>` (TTL=10m, ephemeral) |
| Pickup coords | Looked up via `BranchClient.getBranch(branchId)` (cached); no need to snapshot — branch coords change at branch-edit time, not per-order |
| Dropoff coords | `orders.delivery_lat / delivery_lng` |
| Earning amount | `agent_earnings.amount` (one row per delivered order) |

Rationale (per agreed PNG design): the deliveries table was buying us a reassignment audit chain that we don't need at v1. Counter-only on `orders.assignment_attempts` enforces `MAX_REASSIGNMENT_ATTEMPTS`; per-attempt history lives in WS event logs / structured app logs if forensics are ever needed.

---

### 3.8 `agent_presence`

Tracks delivery agents that are currently online and their last known location. PostGIS `GEOGRAPHY` column for radius queries.

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_presence (
    agent_id        BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,                           -- logical FK -> core.users.id
    region          TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_online       BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    last_lat        DECIMAL(10,7) NULL,
    last_lng        DECIMAL(10,7) NULL,
    last_seen_at    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    location        GEOGRAPHY(Point, 4326) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
                        ST_MakePoint(last_lng::float, last_lat::float)::geography
                    ) STORED,
    updated_at      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- supports automatic assignment: find nearest online agents to a pickup point
CREATE INDEX idx_agent_presence_location_gist ON agent_presence USING GIST (location) WHERE is_online = TRUE;
-- supports cleanup of stale presence rows
CREATE INDEX idx_agent_presence_last_seen_at ON agent_presence (last_seen_at) WHERE is_online = TRUE;
```

Notes:
- We use a single row per agent (UPSERT on ping). Historical presence is **not** retained here — out of scope.
- Hot reads (assignment scan) use Redis as a write-through cache (`presence:<region>:<agentId>`) to avoid hitting Postgres on every order.

---

### 3.9 `agent_earnings`

A per-order earning snapshot for reporting. Could be derived from `transactions` but a denormalized table makes earnings reads cheap.

Idempotency key is `order_id` (was `delivery_id` in the original draft; that column is gone with the deliveries table). Composite FK targets the partitioned `orders(id, created_at)` parent.

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_earnings (
    id                  BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    region              TEXT NOT NULL,
    agent_id            BIGINT NOT NULL,                          -- logical FK -> core.users.id (delivery_agent role)
    order_id            BIGINT NOT NULL,
    order_created_at    TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,                    -- partition-key copy, required for the FK
    amount              INT NOT NULL,                             -- minor units
    currency            TEXT NOT NULL,
    earned_at           TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),

    CONSTRAINT fk_agent_earnings_order_id
      FOREIGN KEY (order_id, order_created_at)
      REFERENCES orders (id, created_at)
      ON DELETE CASCADE,
    CONSTRAINT uq_agent_earnings_order_id UNIQUE (order_id)
);

-- supports GET /agents/earnings?from=&to=
CREATE INDEX idx_agent_earnings_agent_earned_at ON agent_earnings (agent_id, earned_at DESC);
```

Inserted in the same transaction as the `orders.status='delivered'` flip. The unique on `order_id` makes the operation idempotent (a duplicate `deliver` call is a no-op for earnings).

---

### 3.10 `idempotency_keys`

Belt-and-suspenders durability for critical write paths. Redis handles the hot path; this table is the source of truth if Redis is lost or evicts the key.

```sql
CREATE TABLE idempotency_keys (
    key_hash        BYTEA PRIMARY KEY,                            -- sha256 of (method + path + key)
    region          TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id         BIGINT NOT NULL,
    request_fingerprint BYTEA NOT NULL,                           -- sha256 of request body
    response_status INT NOT NULL,
    response_body   JSONB NOT NULL,
    created_at      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    expires_at      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL                            -- 24h TTL
);

-- supports cleanup
CREATE INDEX idx_idempotency_keys_expires_at ON idempotency_keys (expires_at);
```

Used only by `POST /orders` and `POST /payments/init`. Looked up after a Redis miss; if request fingerprint doesn't match the original, return 409 (idempotency conflict).

### 3.11 `payment_webhook_events`

Raw webhook log for audit and replay.

```sql
CREATE TABLE payment_webhook_events (
    id              BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    region          TEXT NOT NULL,
    provider_id     INT NOT NULL,
    provider_event_id TEXT NOT NULL,                              -- de-dup key from provider
    signature       TEXT NOT NULL,
    payload         JSONB NOT NULL,
    received_at     TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    processed_at    TIMESTAMP NULL,
    process_error   TEXT NULL,

    CONSTRAINT uq_payment_webhook_events_provider_event_id UNIQUE (provider_id, provider_event_id)
);

-- supports replay/audit by order via session lookup; no additional index needed beyond the unique.
```

Webhook handler:
1. Verify signature.
2. Try `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. If conflict → already processed (or in flight), return 200 immediately.
3. Otherwise, in a transaction: parse payload, advance order/session/transaction state, set `processed_at`. (No outbox event — see §0 — the WebSocket fan-out is enough for clients.)

### 3.12 ~~`core_inbound_events`~~ — removed

Dedupe for core-event messages lives in **Redis**, not SQL. One `SET core-events:dedupe:<eventId> "1" NX EX 86400` per message.

Rationale:
- The only thing this table did for correctness was dedupe. Redis SETNX gives the same guarantee in one round-trip, no table, no migration, no per-shard insert on every broker message.
- Every registered consumer handler is an idempotent cache invalidation (`cache.del(key)`). If dedupe expires and a handler re-runs, the operation is a no-op. Safe.
- Failures still go to the DLQ — that's the observability path, not a `process_error` column.

Consumer flow (in `lib/core-events/consumer.ts`):
1. Receive message from `order-service.core-events`.
2. `cache.trySet("core-events:dedupe:<eventId>", "1", 86400)` → if not fresh, ack + skip.
3. Dispatch by `eventType` to the registered handler.
4. On success → ack. On failure → nack (no requeue) → message flows to DLQ.

## 4. FK / relationship map (in-shard)

```
orders ──(id, created_at)── order_items
orders ──(id, created_at)── transactions
orders ──(id, created_at)── payment_sessions
orders ──(id, created_at)── agent_earnings
transactions ──(id)── transactions  (refunded_payment_id self-ref)
```

`orders` is partitioned by `created_at`, so every child FK is composite `(order_id, order_created_at) → orders(id, created_at)`.

Logical (cross-service):

```
core.users         ← orders.customer_id, orders.delivery_agent_id
core.users         ← transactions.src_acc_id, dst_acc_id, agent_presence.agent_id, agent_earnings.agent_id
core.restaurants   ← orders.restaurant_id, restaurant_balances.restaurant_id
core.restaurant_branches ← orders.branch_id
core.customer_addresses  ← orders.customer_address_id
core.products      ← order_items.product_id
```

No speculative indexes. No `CREATE INDEX` lands without a query path comment in the migration.

## 6. Migration plan (file order)

Each migration creates a single coherent unit. Order matters because of FK dependencies (in-shard).

1. `20260507000020_create_orders.ts`                   — `orders` (partitioned) + indexes + delivery columns (`delivery_agent_id`, `assignment_attempts`, `last_assignment_at`).
2. `20260507000030_create_order_items.ts`              — `order_items` + composite FK + index.
3. `20260507000100_create_idempotency_keys.ts`         — `idempotency_keys`.
4. `20260510000010_create_payment_providers.ts`        — seed `kashier`, `cod`.
5. `20260510000040_create_payment_sessions.ts`         — `payment_sessions` + indexes.
6. `20260510000050_create_transactions.ts`             — `transactions` + indexes.
7. `20260510000110_create_payment_webhook_events.ts`   — `payment_webhook_events`.
8. `…_create_restaurant_balances.ts`                   — `restaurant_balances` (Phase 3 migration).
9. `…_create_agent_presence.ts`                        — extension PostGIS, `agent_presence` + GIST + partial btree (Phase 3).
10. `…_create_agent_earnings.ts`                       — `agent_earnings` + composite FK + index (Phase 3).

(No `deliveries` migration — see §3.7. No core-event dedupe table — Redis.)

(Core-event dedupe is Redis, not a migration.)

All migrations run in **every region**. There is no global database for this service.

The cold archive cluster (Phase 7) runs the same migration set against `order_service_archive` per region — same schema, different cluster.

## 7. Open questions / future work

- **Multi-currency restaurants**: when a restaurant operates in multiple regions/currencies, decide whether to keep one row per (restaurant, currency) in `restaurant_balances` or one row per region.
- **Geo-fencing for delivery radius**: today we only filter by branch's `delivery_radius` (in core). If we move that to this service, add a PostGIS column on a snapshot.
- **Refunds policy**: partial refunds need `refund_amount` ≤ original charge — enforce with a check trigger, deferred for now.
- **Cross-region history**: with country-level shards, a customer ordering across countries is rare. If/when needed, fan out at the controller level instead of maintaining a `customer_order_index`.
