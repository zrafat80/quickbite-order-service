# Business Logic — Orders Module

Owner module: `app/order/`

Responsible for the customer-facing order placement, the order header lifecycle, and the read paths used by customers, restaurants, and admins.

### Transition rules

- Single endpoint `PATCH /orders/{orderId}/status` updates restaurant-side state. Body: `{ status }`. Service validates the requested target is **legal from current status** and **allowed for the actor**.
- Forbidden transitions return **409**.
- Each transition stamps the corresponding `<verb>_at` column inside the same trx.
- Each transition publishes a WebSocket event to `customer:<id>`, `branch:<id>`, and (where relevant) `agent:<id>`.

### Allowed transitions matrix (target by current)

| from \ to        | accepted | rejected | preparing | ready | assigned | picked | delivered | cancelled |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | ----- | -------- | ------ | --------- | --------- |
| `placed`         | ✅ rest  | ✅ rest  |           |       |          |        |           | ✅ cust*  |
| `accepted`       |          |          | ✅ rest   |       |          |        |           | ✅ rest   |
| `preparing`      |          |          |           | ✅ rest|          |        |           | ✅ rest   |

\* customer cancel window: until `accepted_at` is set OR within 60s of `placed`.

## 2. POST /orders — placement (the most critical path)

### Inputs (request DTO)

```ts
class CreateOrderRequestDTO {
  branchId: number;             // required, validated against core-cached branch metadata
  customerAddressId: number;    // required, validated via core-client
  paymentMethod: 'online' | 'cod';
  items: Array<{ productId: number; quantity: number }>;  // required, non-empty
}
```

Header: `Idempotency-Key` (required, `idempotency({strict: true})` middleware).

### Algorithm

1. **Resolve region**. From `X-Region` / `?region=` / cookie, or derived from the chosen `branchId` via the cached branch metadata. The order goes to the **branch's region (country)** shard. With country-level shards, the customer is almost always in the same country as the branch.
2. **Validate branch** via cache then `core-client`. If branch is `accept_orders=false` or restaurant `status != 'active'` → 409 `BranchNotAcceptingOrders`.
3. **Validate address** via `core-client`. Capture `lat/lng/address_text` for the snapshot.
4. **Fetch product prices/stock** for the requested items in **a single batch call** to `core-client.getBranchProducts(branchId, productIds)`. If any product is missing, unavailable, or `stock < quantity` → 409 with offending product list.
5. **Compute money**:
   - `subtotal = Σ unitPrice × quantity` (all in minor units).
   - `delivery_fee = branch.deliveryFee` (cached).
   - `service_fee = floor(subtotal × platform_service_rate)` — config-driven, currently 0.
   - `total = subtotal + delivery_fee + service_fee`.
6. **In one trx on the branch's region**:
   - Insert `orders` with `status = paymentMethod === 'online' ? 'pending_payment' : 'placed'`.
   - Insert `order_items` (one INSERT … VALUES … with multiple rows).
   - For COD: insert `transactions(type='cod_collection', status='pending', amount=total, src_acc_id=customer, dst_acc_id=restaurantOwner)`.
   - Decrement product stock via `core-client.reserveStock(branchId, items)` — **out-of-trx**, after commit. If reserve fails, we void the order (status=`cancelled`, reason=`out_of_stock_post_commit`). This is acceptable: stock was last verified seconds ago.
7. **Commit**.
8. For `online`: hand off to payment service to create a Kashier session (separate endpoint `POST /payments/init`, or auto-trigger from the same controller — see §3).
9. Publish WS `order.created` to `branch:<branchId>` (only for COD; online waits for capture).
10. Return the `OrderResponseDTO`.

### Concurrency / race conditions

- Two simultaneous orders racing the same last unit of stock: handled in `core-service` reserveStock (atomic decrement; returns 409 if any item underflows).
- Idempotency: same key + same body within 24h → returns the original response. Same key + **different** body → 409 `IdempotencyConflict` (we hash the request body).

### Failure modes

- Kashier creation fails after order insert → order remains in `pending_payment`. The customer can retry `POST /payments/init` (also idempotent) or the order auto-cancels after 15 min via a background sweep job.

---

## 3. POST /orders — online vs COD execution

The simplest UX is to keep `POST /orders` and `POST /payments/init` as **two separate calls** — the order returns its `publicId`, the client then calls `POST /payments/init { orderId }`. This keeps endpoints small and idempotent independently.

(An alternate endpoint `POST /orders/with-payment` could combine both for a single round-trip; deferred unless mobile asks.)

---

## 4. GET /orders/{orderId}

- `orderId` here is the **public_id** (UUID).
- Lookup is by `public_id` index, single shard.
- Region resolution: same priority (`?region=` / `X-Region` / cookie). A customer reading an order in their own country passes `X-Region` (set by the gateway) or the server derives it from the order's `public_id` only if we ever add a region prefix — today we require the region to be supplied.
- Authorization: customer == `order.customer_id`; restaurant user must own the restaurant or be a member of `branch_id`; admin sees all.
- Response includes:
  - Order header (DTO).
  - Items.
  - Latest delivery (if any).
  - Payment summary (status of latest `transaction(type='charge'|'cod_collection')`).
- All in **one** repository call (single SQL with joins). No N+1.

---

## 5. GET /customer/orders?year=YYYY

- Cursor-paginated.
- Defaults `year` to the current year if omitted.
- For current year → query `orders` on customer's home shard via `idx_orders_customer_id_created_at`.
- For historical years → route to the **archive cluster** (Phase 7) for the same region. Same indexes, same shape.
- Cross-country lookup is not optimized for in this milestone (extremely rare).

---

## 6. GET /restaurant/orders

- Filters: `branchId`, `status`, `from`, `to`.
- Cursor pagination (`createdAt` desc).
- Authorization: `requireRestaurantMember(restaurantId)` + `requireBranchAccess(branchId)`.
- Hot endpoint → backed by `idx_orders_branch_status_created_at` + `@UseInterceptors(UnifiedCacheInterceptor) @CacheScope('PUBLIC')` (10s TTL) for the typical "pending in this branch" page.
- Cache invalidated on every status transition for that branch (the service clears `restaurant:orders:<branchId>:*`).

---

## 7. PATCH /orders/{orderId}/status

- Single endpoint. The server inspects `currentStatus` and the actor's role to decide if the requested transition is allowed.
- Each transition uses a small helper `assertTransition(from, to, actorContext)` that throws `InvalidStatusTransition` otherwise.
- Side effects per transition:
  - `accepted` → stamp `accepted_at`; WS to customer.
  - `rejected` → stamp `rejected_at`; trigger refund or void COD; WS to customer.
  - `preparing` → stamp; WS.
  - `ready` → stamp; **enqueue auto-assignment** (delivery service).
  - `assigned` → only system writes this status (assignment service). Manual admin override goes through `POST /deliveries/assign/{orderId}` not this endpoint.
  - `cancelled` → stamp `cancelled_at`, body must include `reason`. If online & captured → trigger refund. If COD → void the pending `cod_collection` transaction.

---

## 8. Invariants

1. `total = subtotal + delivery_fee + service_fee` always.
2. `commission ≤ subtotal`.
3. The status sequence is monotonic (no jumping back).
4. `delivered_at IS NOT NULL` ⇒ all dependent rows: `transactions(type='charge', status='succeeded')` exists, `restaurant_balances` updated, `agent_earnings` row exists.
5. `pending_payment` orders older than 15 min are cancelled by a background sweep.
6. A customer cannot read another customer's order, even with the public_id.
7. A restaurant user cannot read orders for branches they aren't a member of (unless owner).

---

## 9. Cancellation policy (codified)

- **Customer cancellation**: allowed only while `status IN ('pending_payment', 'placed')` AND no more than 60s after `placed_at`. After that, the customer can't cancel; they must call support.
- **Restaurant cancellation**: allowed at any time before `picked`. Requires a `reason`. Triggers refund/void.
- **System cancellation**: timeouts (`pending_payment` > 15 min); failed assignment after max retries (see Deliveries module).

---

## 10. Refund handling on cancellation

- If the order was online and a `transaction(type='charge', status='succeeded')` exists → call payment service's `refund(orderId, amount=total)`. This is async (Kashier processes; we get a webhook).
- If COD with no money collected yet → flip the pending `cod_collection` to `failed` and write `transaction(type='adjustment', amount=0, ...)` for the audit trail (no money moved).

## 11. RBAC

| Action                                      | Roles allowed                                                     |

| `GET /orders/{id}`                          | `customer` (own), `restaurant_user` (member of branch), `system_admin` |
| `GET /customer/orders`                      | `customer`                                                         |
| `GET /restaurant/orders`                    | `restaurant_user` (`orders:read`), `system_admin`                  |
| `PATCH /orders/{id}/status` → accept/reject | `restaurant_user` with `orders:accept`                             |
| `PATCH /orders/{id}/status` → preparing/ready | `restaurant_user` with `orders:update`                           |
| `PATCH /orders/{id}/status` → cancelled     | `customer` (own, window), `restaurant_user` (`orders:cancel`), `system_admin` |

Permission seed (added to core's RBAC seed migration):

```
orders:read, orders:accept, orders:update, orders:cancel
```

Mapped to roles:

- `owner` → all four.
- `branch_manager` → all four.
- `staff` → `orders:read`, `orders:update`, `orders:accept` (no cancel).
